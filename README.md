We have developed a simple STC wallet under testnet. It looks like DOS style, but including core function

Create address, 
Create mnemonic (EN, CN, KO)
Import/ export mnemonic ，
Transfer /receive STC coin，
Balance checking
...

Now we release the wallet demo to the public. You can try it now.

Thanks to STC official developers for offering internal test api and some technical documents.
